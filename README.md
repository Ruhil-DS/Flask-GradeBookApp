# Flask-GradeBookApp

In this simple web application that I have developed, I have tried to encode the concept of a grade book.

Using this app, we are presented with a form where we can choose to select the student ID or the course ID and we need to enter the respective ID.
Based on the choice, we can be presented with the following - 
 - Marks of the student in all the courses that he has opted for.
 - Course summary with a histogram which presents the marks distribution in a graphical way.
 - Error page, if entered any wrong choice.

A detailed note on how the project has been performed is present in the Week4_LA.pdf file

All the respective files needed are also bundled in the zip - 21f2001180.zip
